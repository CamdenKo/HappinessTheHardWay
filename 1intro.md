# Intro

This is not a self-help guide. This is an actualization toolkit.

As a self diagnosed self-help addict, I've perused every blog offering "9 Ways to Find Purpose", books teaching "How to Win Friends and Influence People", and YouTube video essays on self actualization that could possibly improve my life. The problem with most of this content comes from the fact that the advice is *perscriptive*, as if every single human being from a million different walks of life can add a couple habits, change the way they percieve problems, or take ice cold showers every morning and find happiness.

That doesn't work.

## Last First Day

My Mom gave me a hug and with bleary eyes bid me good luck into turning into an adult. To which, I promptly told her, "Don't worry Mom, I think I'm done maturing. I'll probably be the same Camden you see today in four years."

NOPE.

So here I am, at the start of my last year at Vanderbilt University, after researching in a lab, teaching, consulting, working in finance, and coding, falling in love with the wrong girl, losing the right girl, reforming my values and beliefs, discovering friendships, and making the frightening leap to adulthood, hoping to give the advice that eluded me throughout my time at college.

## How is this Different

"The chasm from childhood to adulthood cannot be crossed with words alone."
- Emily Jia (I think)

Instead, what this series will offer is stories, wisdom, and resources, such that you can find your own path, your own calling. This won't change your life overnight. This won't give you a magic list of todo's that will energize you to jump out of bed in the morning. This isn't a quick series that you can read on the subway on the way to work, learn everything you need and move on. This won't be a map that walks you step by step to being a fulfilled adult.

No. This is a resource for those who are looking for advice, for an honest look at what it really takes to be fulfilled. This is a living document that changes and grows as I change and grow as well. This is a compass and a toolkit, something that points you in the right direction and helps clear out the path ahead. Ultimately, it'll be up to you forge your own path.

## How to Read

All that's going to be offered is suggestions. Take them as such. Most of the content will be tailored to what resonated with myself. Try to take the general idea of what is being presented and take it upon yourself to understand what this truly means for yourself. The goal here isn't to simply change how you live life, it's about changing **why** you live your life the way you do. Instead of offering advice on how happy people live their lives, this will be advice on how to find your own happiness, and the habits and lifestyle will follow naturally.

Be patient with yourself. It's a long journey.
