# Happiness the Hard Way

A guide for being happy - the hard way.

As a self diagnosed self-help addict, I've perused every blog offering "9 Ways to Find Purpose", books teaching "How to Win Friends and Influence People", and YouTube video essays on self actualization that could possibly improve my life. The problem with most of this content comes from the fact that the advice is *perscriptive*, as if every single human being from a million different walks of life can add a couple habits, change the way they percieve problems, or take ice cold showers every morning and find happiness.

That doesn't work.

Everyone is different, so a map guiding you to where you need to go won't be effective. Instead, this document is a compass and toolkit, something that points you in the right direction and helps clear out the path ahead.

I'm working on this actively, so there's going to be some dust whilst under construction, but feel free to start reading and offer feedback. The intro is the best place to start. If you want a general understanding of what topics are going to be covered, feel free to check out `0outline.md`.

Godspeed friend.
